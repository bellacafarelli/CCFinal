    <p> This game is a short version of a longer “Choose Your Own Adventure Game.” I enjoy playing these types of games and I wanted to try to create one myself. In this game, the player has to help Randy, the main character, get ready for his day. The question you’ll answer in this version is for his outfit, as you have to choose the right one in order to proceed. I thought using videos for scenes would be an interesting approach to this project and help follow along with the story. If you lose, you’ll be able to restart and try again.</p>
